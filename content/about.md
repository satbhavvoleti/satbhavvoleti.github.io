![Satbhav Voleti](../images/Satbhav.jpg)

I am currently Satbhav Voleti, an incoming masters' student of philosophy at Università della Svizzera italiana, Lugano in Switzerland. I am interested in studying 'fusion' philosophy focusing on analytic techniques in the South Asian traditions broadly conceived. The metaphysical and epistemological debates in post-Diṅnāga Sanskrit philosophy are of the utmost interest to me as of now. More broadly, I am interested in an investigation of the history of process philosophy as present in non-Western philosophies of action, metaphysics and epistemology.
