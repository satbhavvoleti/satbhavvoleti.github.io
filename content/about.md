![Satbhav Voleti](../images/Satbhav.jpg)

I am currently Satbhav Voleti, a masters' student of philosophy at Università della Svizzera italiana, Lugano in Switzerland. I am interested in studying philosophy focusing on analytic techniques and in conversation with the South Asian traditions broadly conceived. Issues in metaphysics and philosophy of mind are of the utmost interest to me as of now. More broadly, I am interested in an investigation of the history of process philosophy as present in non-Western philosophies of action, metaphysics and epistemology.
