## Bergsonism

It is only appropriate to attribute the birth of Bergsonisms to the creative openness of Bergson's works. How is it possible that Bergson's works have received such varied interpretations? Forgotten for the second half of the twentieth-century, Bergsonism has not enjoyed a prominent position in contemporary academic philosophy. However, Bergson has sustained an undercurrent of relevance through Whitehead, Merleau-Ponty, James and others. What are the reasons for Bergsonism's thriving after it fell out of fashion with the growth of analytic philosophy, phenomenology and post-structuralism? 

Bergson introduces four key ideas which blossom into a variety of offshoots and outgrowths in their reception and critical evaluation around the world. A palpably Bergsonian philosophy must intercept these concepts: duration, intuition, novelty and elan vital. These concepts characterize Bergsonism as (i) processual, (ii) creative, (iii) empiricist and (iv) open. I shall call a philosopher's work historically inspired by Bergson in some way or another and characterized by these qualities a Bergsonism. Part of my task in this particular essay is to argue that these qualities are both distinctive and irreplaceable for Bergson(ism). The other part is to provide a description of what exactly these qualities entail; for example, what does empiricism *mean* for Bergson?

In this series of posts, I will attempt to elucidate the importance of these concepts. In doing so, I hope to argue that Bergsonism is a wholly unique and extremely fluid process philosophy which can be moulded and adapted to differing ends fruitfully. This will be the first in a series of posts attempting to extricate Bergsonisms from lesser known interpreters and appropriators.
