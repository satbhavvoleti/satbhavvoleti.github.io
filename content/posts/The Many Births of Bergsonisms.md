## Bergsonism

It is only appropriate to attribute the birth of Bergsonisms to the creative openness of Bergson's works. How is it possible that Bergson's works have received such varied interpretations? Forgotten for the second half of the twentieth-century, Bergsonism has not enjoyed a prominent position in contemporary academic philosophy. However, Bergson has sustained an undercurrent through Whitehead, Merleau-Ponty, James and others. What are the reasons for Bergsonism to thrive today after it fell out of fashion with the growth of analytic philosophy and post-structuralism? 

Bergson introduces four key ideas which blossom into a variety of offshoots and outgrowths in their reception and critical evaluation around the world. A distinctly Bergsonian philosophy must intercept these concepts: duration, intuition, novelty and elan vital. These concepts characterize Bergsonism as processual, creative, empiricist and open. In this essay, I will attempt to elucidate the importance of these concepts. In doing so, I shall argue that Bergsonism is a wholly unique and extremely fluid process philosophy which can be moulded and adapted to differing ends fruitfully. This will be the first in a series of essays attempting to extricate Bergsonisms from lesser known interpreters.
