I made a (criminally) short [presentation](../files/Short%20History%20of%20Philosophy%20of%20Language.pdf) for a discussion session on analytic philosophy of language, focusing on the second half of the twentieth centuryâ€“Quine, Wittgenstein, Davidson, Lewis, Kripke, Putnam, Dummett, Grice and Austin. It is fairly amateurish and incredibly compressed but gives a highlights tour of the subject.
