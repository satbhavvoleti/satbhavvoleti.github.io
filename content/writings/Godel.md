My dear friend, Aditya Dwarkesh (you can find him [here](https://adityadwarkesh.github.io)), and I wrote an expository article on Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems and their colourful reception in the philosophical and mathematical circles of their time. We discuss the immediate reception by Zermelo, Wittgenstein and others, as well as the philosophical fallout of the theorems in various fields—philosophy of mathematics, information theory and philosophy of mind. This article was published in the Indian Science Cruiser in 2021. You can find the article [here](../files/Godel's%20Incompleteness%20Theorems.pdf).  
As a supplement to this article, we presented a [poster](../files/Incompleteness%20Poster.pdf) of a rigorous proof of the theorems on the Mathematics & Statistics Department Day at IISER-Kolkata.
