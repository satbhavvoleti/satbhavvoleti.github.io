While reading various early modern texts of Europe, I made some (highly unoriginal) [notes](../files/Western%20Modern%20Philosophy.pdf) by an almost collage method; pulling from many secondaries on major figures of the time period. The notes are highly incomplete and are a slow work in progress, but the main sources were Jeffrey Tlumak's *Classical Modern Philosophy*, Dan Garber's work on Decartes, and Michael Ayer's *Locke: Epistemology and Ontology*. Maybe they can be of some help for skimming through before an exam?
