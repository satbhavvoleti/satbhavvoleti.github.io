While attending the brilliant workshop, [PhilSciIndia](https://www.philsciindia.com/) 2021, I presented an application of Nyāya responses to Nāgārjuna's version of the problem of criterion to modern skepticism about experimental apparatus (by the sociologist Harry Collins). The idea was to recreate a reliabilist account of scientific epistemology for experiments. You can find the presentation [here](../files/Experimenter's%20Regress.pdf).
