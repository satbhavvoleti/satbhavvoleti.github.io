As a part of my master's project work, I presented the symbolization of Navya-Nyāya technical language developed by Jonardon Ganeri and Eberhard Guhe. In doing so, I attempted to explain the mathematical structures used, especially the contrast in the extensional and intensional approaches. I also discussed some elementary philosophical reasons why both capture different aspects of the technical language and neither are entirely satisfactory for a liberal naturalist of the Naiyāyika strain. In lieu of a recording, I have uploaded the slides [here](../files/Early_Modern_Sanskrit_Logic_and_Self-Reference.pdf).
