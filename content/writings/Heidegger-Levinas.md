You can find a note on a quick comparison between Heidegger and what Levinas brings new to the table [here](../files/Heidegger-Levinas.pdf). I made this note to really raise the question of how the overturning of ontology in favour of ethics affects logic (for context: Mohanty claims that Heidegger's privileging of ontology over logic engenders a pre-theoretical discloure of being).
