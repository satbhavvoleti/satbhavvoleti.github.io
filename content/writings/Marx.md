My dear friend, [Aditya](https://adityadwarkesh.github.io), and I made some elementary notes on Allen Wood's book *Karl Marx*. We finished approximately half of it and summarized the sections on alienation, (the fascinating and perplexing notion) *Gattungswesen* and historical materialism. You can find them [here](../files/Heidegger-Levinas.pdf)
