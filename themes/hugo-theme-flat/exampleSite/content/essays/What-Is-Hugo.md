Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. Originally created by Steve Francia in 2013, Hugo has seen a great increase in both features and performance thanks to current lead developer Bjørn Erik Pedersen (since v0.14 in 2015[4]) and other contributors. Hugo is an open source project licensed under the Apache License 2.0.[5]

Being able to generate most websites within seconds (at < 1 ms per page), Hugo's official website states it is "the world’s fastest framework for building websites". In July 2015, Netlify began providing Hugo hosting,[6] and in 2017, Smashing Magazine completed its redesign of their website, migrating from WordPress to a JAMstack solution with Hugo.[7]
