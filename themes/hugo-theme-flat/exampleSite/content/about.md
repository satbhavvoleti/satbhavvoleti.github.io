## CJK supported

This hugo theme support CJK language, but some right to left language may not act as expected. Let's just test CJK layout!

这一句话是用中文写的，一般情况下，中英文排版如果字体设置不当，显示出来的字号会有相当的差距，即便实际上的字号是相同的。这个问题暂时看来无法彻底解决，唯一能做的就是挑选合适的字体，使相同字号下，中英文在展示出来后肉眼感官大小差别不大。

Try another typography, which make English and Chinese lay down in a single line. The word *Chinese* in Chinese is "中文".
